# Bitcoin-Price - machine-learning

In this project, it analyzes cryptocurrency historical price data to build predictive models for regression, classification, and decision trees. Using historical prices and market market capitalizations as features, multiple machine learning models were trained to make predictions and evaluate their performance. 

The goal of this project is to explorehow different algorithms perform in predicting trends, price points, or classification tasks related to cryptocurrencies. The project includes the implementation of multiple models, comparison of their accuracies, comparison of their mean-absolute-errors and insights derived from the analysis. 

Features:
- Dataset: Histrocial prices and market capitalizations of Bitcoin
- Regression Models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Logistic Regression
- Classification Models: Classification Tree
- Decision Tree Models: Decision Tree
- Model Comparison: evaluate and compare the accuracies from different machine learning models

Methodology:
1) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: removing unecessary columns, handled missing values
2) Exploratory Data Analysis: visualized historical price trends
3) Model training:
4) Model Evaluation: Metrics used Mean Absolute Error (MAE), calculated accuracy
